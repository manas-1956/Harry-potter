# Harry-potter
  Everybody who has watched or read Harry Potter series will be knowing about the famous cloak (One of the deathy hallows instance)
  Main concept is that this project uses Opencv and numpy concepts. All this code does is rejects red and green colour providing a better image enhancement for cloak effect. Not exactly crystal clear output but works just fine.
